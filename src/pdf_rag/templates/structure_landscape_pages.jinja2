Analyze the table of contents (TOC) in <toc> and the pages of the slides deck provided in <pages>.
Group the pages under their corresponding TOC sections using this format:

# [TOC Section]
- Page X : [Full Page Title]
- Page Y : [Full Page Title]

Rules:
- Each TOC section should have an appropriate level heading with #, ##, or ###.
- List all pages that belong under each section
- Maintain original page numbers and full titles
- Include pages even if their titles are slightly different from TOC entries
- Group subsections under their main section
- List pages in numerical order within each section
- Don't omit any pages
- If a page doesn't clearly fit under a TOC section, place it under "Other Pages"

Example:
# Introduction
- Page 1 : Welcome Slide
- Page 2 : Project Overview

# Key Findings
- Page 3 : Financial Results
- Page 4 : Market Analysis
